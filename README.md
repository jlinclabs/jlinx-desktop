## Login with Jlinx

Allowing anyone to create an account in your app by providing, at least, a 
[DID](link-to-dids), if not a full profile.


### User's Experience

1. user clicks "signup/login with JLINX"
2. your app generates an provides login code (as QR code and 43 char string)
3. the user hits "add account" in their jlinx app and provides the given code
4. the user is logged into your app


### Technical

1. your app generates a new UserAccountDocument
1.1 [TODO something needs to be signed with the app's public key]
2. that document's hypercore public key is given to the user
3. the user's jlinx app thenâ€¦ 
3.1. reads that document (also tracks it) 
3.2. extracts a url to post back to
3.3. creates its own UserAccountDocument
3.4. post back to that url with a signed jwt containing the pairwise UserAccountDocument id

the jlinx app can then write whatever keys/values it wants to its UserAccountDocument
and the app should periodically sync to it. 

the payload from the server can express the required details for signing up

the app can also direct the user to futher signup steps after the login-with-jlinx
process is complete. 


the jlinx app and the service providing app both keep records of the corisponding UserAccountDocument. Either side could alter their document to close/disable/destroy
the account.

## Questions

- should we encrypt everything?
  - burn-notice records are easy to comply to. throw away your read key
  - we could send hypercode public keys along with a ready-key
